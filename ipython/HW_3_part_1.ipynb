If $\\lambda<0$ then the true solution is exponentially decaying.  On the other hand, for $\\lambda<0$ and $k>0$ the point $z=k\\lambda$ is never in the region of absolute stability of this method (see Example 7.7), and hence the numerical solution should be growing exponentially for any nonzero time step. (And yet it converges to a function that is exponentially decaying.) Suppose we take $U^0=\\eta$, use Forward Euler to generate $U^1$, and then use the midpoint method for $n=2,~3,~\\ldots$. Work out the exact solution $U^n$ by solving the linear difference equation and explain how the apparent paradox described above is resolved. "
