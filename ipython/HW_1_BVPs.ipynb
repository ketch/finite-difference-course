At the boundaries, you will need additional values $U_{-1}$ and $U_{m+2}$; assume that they are equal to $\\alpha, \\beta$ respectively. Write a function to set up the matrix $A$ corresponding to this method.  How do the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this matrix compare to those of the tridiagonal matrix discussed in class? By computing the eigenvalues of $A$ for different values of $m$, try to determine experimentally whether this method is stable.  "
